## **Introduction**

The goal is to develop an application that processes email exchanges, categorizes them, and generates appropriate responses using **Next.js**, **LangGraphJS**, **MongoDB**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The plan focuses on iterative development through **Epics** to deliver functional increments promptly.

- **So that** I can perform my function effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Actors retrieve instructions relevant to them.
- Instructions are filtered by actor name and category.
- Retrieval is efficient and returns accurate results.
- Unit tests cover memory fetching logic.

**Story Points:** 3

#### **User Story 2.3**
- **As a** developer
- **I want to** implement the main agent graph structure using LangGraphJS
- **So that** we have a central orchestration point for all our agents and processes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Main agent graph is implemented using LangGraphJS.
- Graph structure matches the design in Agent_Graph.mmd.
- Email Categorizer is integrated as a node in the main graph.
- Graph can be easily extended to add other actors/nodes.
- Basic error handling and logging are implemented.
- Unit tests cover the main graph structure and flow.

**Story Points:** 8

#### **User Story 2.4**
- **As the** Email Categorizer Actor
- **I want to** categorize incoming emails using an LLM
- **So that** the system can process emails appropriately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- LLM is integrated for email categorization.
- Emails are assigned accurate categories.
- Categorization accuracy meets predefined benchmarks.
- System stores assigned categories in WM.

**Story Points:** 8

### **Epic 3: Response Generation and Validation**

**Objective:** Implement response generation and validation mechanisms.

#### **User Story 3.1**

- **As the** Memory Mapping Agent
- **I want to** fetch and validate instructions for actors
- **So that** the actors can generate appropriate responses.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Memory Mapping Agent retrieves relevant instructions from LAM.
- Instructions are validated using an LLM.
- Invalid or irrelevant instructions are identified.
- System handles cases with no valid memories gracefully.

**Story Points:** 5

---

#### **User Story 3.2**

- **As the** Number of Responses Identifier
- **I want to** determine the number of responses needed based on instructions and email content
- **So that** the system knows how many responses to generate.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Number of responses is correctly identified (0-4).
- Decision logic accounts for different scenarios.
- Users can override the number if necessary.
- Unit tests validate the identifier's functionality.

**Story Points:** 3

---

#### **User Story 3.3**

- **As the** First Response Generator
- **I want to** generate the first response using validated instructions and email content
- **So that** the user receives an appropriate reply.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- First responses are generated accurately using LLM.
- Responses are coherent and contextually appropriate.
- Integration with LLM is seamless.
- Performance meets acceptable response times.

**Story Points:** 8

---

#### **User Story 3.4**

- **As the** Response Validator
- **I want to** validate generated responses to ensure quality
- **So that** only appropriate responses are sent to the user.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Responses are checked for compliance with guidelines.
- Inappropriate content is identified and flagged.
- Feedback is provided for corrections.
- System loops back for regeneration if validation fails.

**Story Points:** 5

#### **User Story 3.5**

- **As a** developer
- **I want to** implement the Episodic Memory (EM) schema
- **So that** the system can store generated drafts and user interactions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- EM schema is defined in MongoDB.
- Generated responses and user edits are stored correctly.
- EM integrates seamlessly with other components.
- Data privacy and compliance are maintained.

**Story Points:** 5

### **Epic 4: User Interface and Deployment**

**Objective:** Build the user interface and prepare the application for deployment.

#### **User Story 4.1**

- **As a** user
- **I want to** view and edit the generated responses
- **So that** I can ensure the responses are appropriate before sending.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- User interface displays generated responses clearly.
- Users can edit responses in a text editor.
- Edited responses are saved and used by the system.
- Interface is responsive and user-friendly.

**Story Points:** 8

#### **User Story 4.2**

- **As a** user
- **I want to** adjust the assigned email category if necessary
- **So that** the system can reprocess the email accordingly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Assigned category is visible to the user.
- Users can change the category via the interface.
- System updates processing based on the new category.
- Changes are reflected in WM and EM.
